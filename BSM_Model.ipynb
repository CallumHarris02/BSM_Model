    "# Black-Scholes-Merton Model\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "I plan to use the Black-Scholes-Merton Model to price European Call Options. Then expand to see some of its uses today and maybe expand and experiment with Monte Carlo Simulations to explore some less standard options.\n",
    "### What I Know\n",
    "To my understanding, the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) Model is a model used for pricing call options. It lays foundational theory used within many financial disciplines today. It is made up of several components, namely; delta, gamma, theta, sigma, vega and is used to calculate the value of a European call option. This then allows for the calculation of a European put option. I believe all parameters are given/calculated precisely excluding volatility which has to be determined through methods discussed later.\n",
    "### What I plan to do\n",
    "I hope to get familiar finding the theoretical value of the price of European Call options through the calculation of the Black Scholes Model. Then I plan to work on the functionality of the model and see how it changes with changes in parameters. I want to understand how useful it is in the finance sector or if it is old news. I am hoping that this can lay the foundation for me to go and explore some other areas of finance such as more quantitative approaches - Monte Carlo Simulation, and work practical applications - Delta and Gamma trading.

    "## Initial Research\n",
    "### A more formal Definition\n",
    "So my initial definition was fairly accurate. The BSM Model is used to price the fair value of an option. Here, fair value refers to the theoretical price of the option, the mathematical expectation of the options payoff. The equation has 5 parameters; volatility, the price of the underlying asset, the time until expiration, the strike price of the option and the risk free interest rate. There are several assumptions of the BSM Model. Firstly, it is assumed no dividends are paid out, market movements are random as they can not be predicted, transaction costs aren't included, the risk free and volatility rate are held constant and the option is European.\n",
    "### Use in the financial world\n",
    "Many traders and investors use the BSM model as foundations in todays options market. Knowing the theoretical price of an option can help with risk management - understanding expected returns. It is also beneficial for market efficiency, greater understanding of the pricing of options has allowed for better trading between traders and inverstors. \n",
    "### First Thoughts\n",
    "I hope that the pricing and calculation of the European options given the data should be fairly straightforward. I hope that this will allow for greater understanding as to how one my apply this to further option pricing whilst giving me some exposure to key principles and skills such as risk management and maybe some more advanced trading techniques such as delta and gamma hedging."

    "# Findings and Results\n",
    "The code shows a progression of Black Scholes models - beginning with a basic given input model plugged into the formula. Then a more flexible comparison model when a user can input a company ticker and see how the listed price compares to the given price. Finally a generic interactive graph was created to show how parameters change the value of an option relative to the underlying price of the instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## My Separate Projects\n",
    "#### Basic Hard-Coded Variables\n",
    "There is little to cover here. The model covered all the parameters required to calculate a fair value of a European call option. To develop, the formula for a put call could have been used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### BlackScholes Function with Tickers\n",
    "This had a little more flexibility. It automated a lot of the pulling of stock and option information from yfinance. However, it was limited in some aspects as it would only pull data from the most recent options available and and compare it to the most recently available underlying stock price information. In reality, I doubt this would have much use, it was more for me to see how option prices varied across stocks and how accurate the calculation was in reality to the price. However, it should be noted that estimates for interest rates and volatility were used which limits the accuracy to that of the given prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interactive Plot\n",
    "This was the most effective for understanding how options vary as their parameters change. We can see that the shape of the option against the underlying price stays fairly similar: flat when deep out-of-the-money, this is because the option has no intrinsic value. However, it is not zero as there is still a time value meaning there is an opportunity that it ends up in-the-money (ITM). We can see that as soon as the underlying price gets closer to the strike price the option begins to gain value. This is due to the fact that it is more likely to end at least at-the-money. It is steepest past the exercise price expectedly because that is the highest likelihood of it ending up in-the-money. It should be noted that the higher the volatility, the higher the earlier the graph steepens, this is due to the fact that price swings happen more regularly again allowing for changes in the states of moneyness. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Greeks\n",
    "They have not been discussed or explored much so far but the greeks are measures that assess risk within the options market. Each greek relates to a different underlying variable that impacts options pricing. They all change over time and so traders will regularly check and oversee to understand the risk and manage their portfolio correctly. Here is more information regarding all of them:\n",
    "#### Delta\n",
    "Delta reflects the sensitivity of the option to changes in the price of the underlying. Delta will take a value between plus and minus one (0 to 1 for calls and 0 to -1 for puts) and indicates how much the value will change for a change in 1 unit of price of the underlying. It is also used by professional options traders to calculate the optimal hedge ratio. (This will be explored more in depth in another project) It allows them to essentially stay delta neutral and not be liable to directional risk.\n",
    "#### Gamma\n",
    "This is a second order derivative of the function and indicates the sensitivity to the delta of an option and the underlying price of an asset. It can help determine how volatile a delta is and therefore how much it has to be rebalanced. Values of delta are higher for ATM options - this is because this is when option price is most sensitive to changes in the underlying and therefore the delta is most sensitive. Option traders also partake in gamma hedging meaning that their delta stays relatively neutral while underlying prices change.\n",
    "#### Theta\n",
    "This relates to the time decay in options. Theta is mostly always positive as there is always the chance an option ends in the money if there is still time. However, there is a negatively proportional relationship between the two which accelerates as maturity approaches as the changes in price become more significant due to there being less time after for it to change.\n",
    "#### Vega\n",
    "Vega is the measure of implied volatility. A rise in implied volatility is associated with a rise in likely price swings and therefore higher undertainty which leads to higher prices of the option. Expectedly, vega is at its highest for ATM options.\n",
    "#### Rho\n",
    "Represents the changes between the options value and the interest rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Overall, this project may not show strong application of quantitative methods used in finance but lays a strong foundation into the theory behind options pricing and still forms the basis that many firms use and consider today. This is a theoretical method, next I will focus on Monte-Carlo simulations which provide an analytical solution by simulating thousands of hypothetical pathways to evaluate and determine a fair price.
